Creating a custom pipe in Angular involves a few steps. Here's an example of how to create a custom pipe that formats a string to title case (i.e., the first letter of each word is capitalized).

### Step-by-Step Guide to Creating a Custom Pipe

1. **Generate the Pipe:**
   Use Angular CLI to generate a new pipe. Open your terminal and run:
   
   ng generate pipe titleCase
 
   This command creates two files: `title-case.pipe.ts` and `title-case.pipe.spec.ts`.

2. **Implement the Pipe Logic:**
    Define the logic inside the pipe class by implementing the `PipeTransform` interface.

3. **Use the Pipe in a Template:**
   To use your custom pipe in a template, you first need to import it in an Angular component where you want to use it.:      
   import { TitleCasePipe } from './title-case.pipe';   
     imports: [TitleCasePipe]
